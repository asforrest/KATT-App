## Deployment

This project is saved to a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/asforrest/milestone-2-budgetcalc) and as such is open to the public.

This project has also been [published to Heroku]((https://katt-app.herokuapp.com/) both for evaluation by Code Institute and so that users can access and use the Web App.

This is made possible by Heroku by linked Heroku directly with the Github repository. The master branch has been selected for this purpose and has been setup to automatically deploy when updated.

The development version is currently the same as the deployed version, however this project is a work in progress and will be branched for continuous development while waiting for a final grade during Code Instituteâ€™s evaluation process. After the evaluation period has been completed any changes made to the project will then be committed back to the master branch and will be directly available to users.

### Running The Code Locally

If you wish to download a copy of the code in order to run the code locally, this is also possible. To do this go to the [BudgetCalc repository on GitHub](https://github.com/asforrest/milestone-2-budgetcalc) click on 'Code' in the top right and select the method you want to use to download and run the code locally.

### Running The Code Online In Your Own Environment

If you wish to look at or work on the code in an online IDE, then it's recommended to use GitPot. If your using Google Chrome and you install the [Google Chrome GitPod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en) then you will see green 'Gitpod' button above [the repository](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template) and this will load the code into your own Gitpod environment.
