# Data Centric Development Milestone Project: KATT App
This project has been [deployed to XXX](https://asforrest.github.io/m) and the source code is available in a [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/asforrest/KATT-App)

This is a web app created for the 3rd Milestone Project for [Code Institute course: Full Stack Development](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/).

This web app will make use of technologies covered in the course up to this point including HTML, CSS, Python, Flask and MongoDB in order to demonstrate an understanding of these technologies.

This web app aims to solve a real-world problem by assisting users with their time management.

### Content / Sources

All sources used have been documented throughout the code in the website through the use of comments. The structure of these comment starts with an explanation of what has been adapted for this project and then the source is given.

The main source for this project was the mini-project from the code institute. This project deals with creating a Task Manager app. The data model is similar to the data model for KATT and was therefore used to create the main structure after an design was decided upon.

### Personal Acknowledgements

I would like to thank:
